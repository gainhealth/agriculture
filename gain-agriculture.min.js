At the same time, there is specific interest in the role of the private sector in improving the availability of nutrient-dense foods and delivering them to groups with nutritional deficiencies. Public sector and donor initiatives directed at agriculture and nutrition are thus increasingly partnering with the private sector.\n\nThis tool provides a practical way of focusing value chain-based agricultural initiatives to narrow the gap between the goal of raising the income and/or productivity of producers and/or the people they employ and the goal of improving nutrition. The starting point for the tool is specific interventions to strengthen agriculture-nutrition linkages or interventions that could be directed to this end. The tool has been developed to be applicable specifically to Feed the Future interventions, but is applicable more generally to agricultural interventions.\n\nThroughout, the term "intervention" is used to refer to projects, programs or policies directed at the agricultural sector.  Thus, the tool aims to be applicable to a wide range of actions that have enhancing the income and/or productivity of producers and/or the people they employ as a key objective.\n\nThe tool addresses the following priority issues:\n\n1. Improving nutritional status by linking agriculture and nutrition effectively: The tool provides a means of assessing the extent to which interventions aimed at agriculture improve dietary diversity of poor households in general, or specific target households or individuals.\n\n2. Mobilising private sector inputs for agriculture-nutrition linkages: The tool identifies opportunities and constraints for private sector involvement in making food value chains more "nutrition-friendly".\n\nThe tool is designed to be applied to interventions that take agriculture as their starting point. Thus, it aims to steer the development and/or implementation of interventions that are primarily directed at enhancing agricultural incomes and/or productivity towards demonstrated and more appreciably nutritional improvements. In many cases, these interventions are focused on agricultural commodities that have been selected on the basis of criteria among which nutrition is not the foremost consideration.\n\nThe tool intentionally applies a flexible and broad perspective in considering the nutritional improvements in particular population groups that might be brought about by agricultural interventions. This reflects the fact that agricultural interventions may have given little consideration to these nutritional improvements, such that it is important to be pragmatic about what can be achieved and demonstrated in such contexts and outside of more comprehensive nutrition/health interventions. Thus, while there is frequent reference to "nutritional impacts", this is taken to include both outcomes (for example increased dietary diversity, consumption of nutrient-dense foods and/or nutrient intake) and impacts (for example prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and/or health status). In selected places, the tool aims to capture information on the degree to which there is evidence of these various outcomes and impacts. '},{id:"Introduction2",num:"Introduction 2",type:"part",title:"FAQs",next:"Introduction3",items:[{id:"faqs",type:"html",src:"faqs"}]},{id:"Introduction3",num:"Introduction 3",title:"A part-by-part guide",type:"part",next:"0",description:'The Rapid Assessment Tool has seven parts.\n\nPart 1 identifies the activities, objectives and goals of the interventions, the foods they target and private sector involvement. The private sector is taken here to include not only large companies, but also small firms and informal sector businesses involved in the production, processing and marketing of the food. Part 1 also identifies the main activities and actors, and the improvements that the intervention is designed to achieve, through a process of value-chain mapping.\n\nPart 2 establishes whether the interventions aim to increase consumption of nutrient-dense food, either on-farm or off-farm. Interventions this goal go to Part 6. Part 3 examines how a project promotes on-farm consumption of food, including among paid labour. Part 4 focuses on off-farm consumption and the value chain linkages between production and consumption. The whole-chain approach focuses on four different stages of the value chain: production, transport storage and processing, distribution and consumption. At each, the analysis considers two objectives: 1) maintaining or enhancing the nutritional value of the food; and 2) developing and supporting business relationships that sustain the food-value chain. Part 4 is repeated in Part 5 if the intervention targets increases in consumption by more than one off-farm group.\n\nPart 6 examines the income-enhancement route to tackling undernutrition. Agricultural projects often start with the primary goal of increasing incomes from farming by improving productivity and links to markets. Predominantly, the focus is on farm households, but it is important not to forget potential impacts on the households of paid labour that works on these farms. In practice, however, the linkage between increased household incomes and reduced undernutrition in the same households is sometimes weak. Thus, Part 6 assesses whether and how the interventions focus on strengthening this linkage through promoting consumption of nutrient-dense food that is produced by farm households, acquired as part of the remuneration for paid labour on these farms and/or purchased, and also through the production of additional foods on-farm (for example, through kitchen gardens) that contribute to greater dietary diversity.\n\nPart 7 provides a summary of assessment results. Organised around a series of questions about how the interventions link agriculture to nutrition, this part of the tool identifies the interventions\' strengths and weaknesses and provides a basis for identifying where interventions might consider changes in design to strengthen the nutritional benefits.\n\nHere are some specific instructions on the completion of the tool:\n\n1. The various parts of the tool are moved through in sequence.  The tool automatically saves information entered as you as you go. A "Save" button is also provided at bottom left of the browser window. \n\n2. Users do not have to answer all of the questions presented by the tool. To move to the next question click the "Next" button.\n\n3. Some questions are answered by entering text in the box below the question. Other questions have set categories for answers which are presented in the drop down lists below the question.\n\n4. Note that Parts 7.1 to 7.6  of the tool are completed automatically. This Part provides a summary of the information entered and makes recommendations on actions that should be taken.\n\n5. The "My Notes" button opens a window in which issues, ideas and questions that arise during completion of Parts 2 to 6 of the tool can be noted. Critically, the tool aims to generate thought processes among those engaged in the design and/or implementation of interventions as to how their nutritional impacts can be enhanced and/or better demonstrated. These issues, ideas and questions should be recorded in the "My Notes" window as Parts 2 to 6 are completed.\n\n6. Once the user is satisfied they have completed the survey, they can output a simple print-ready HTML page that can be printed, saved, or copied and pasted into Microsoft Word, other word processors, or email programs. The content of the "My Notes" window will be included in the outputted report as "Part 7.7".'},{id:"0",num:"Start",type:"part",title:"Nutritious Agriculture by Design:",subtitle:"A tool for program planning",steps:[{id:"0.1",parent:"0",type:"section",steps:[{id:"0.1.1",parent:"0.1",type:"question",className:"block",next:"1",items:[{id:"0.1.1.1",label:"Survey Name",type:"input"},{id:"0.1.1.2",label:"Name of the intervention",type:"input"},{id:"0.1.1.3",label:"Organisation designing or managing the intervention",type:"input"},{id:"0.1.1.4",label:"Name of person completing the assessment",type:"input"},{id:"0.1.1.5",label:"Date",type:"input"}]}]}]},{id:"1",num:"Part 1",type:"part",title:"What are the basic characteristics of the intervention?",steps:[{id:"1.1",parent:"1",num:"1.1",type:"section",title:"Brief description of the intervention",description:"This first part of the Rapid Assessment Tool clarifies the basic goals and objectives of the intervention and highlights briefly the interactions with nutrition, poor farmers and business.",steps:[{id:"1.1.1",parent:"1.1",type:"question",next:"1.1.2",items:[{id:"1.1.1.1",num:"1.1",label:"Provide a brief description of the intervention.
